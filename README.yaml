## Workflow Implemented

### 1️ Raw → SDTM Conversion
- Standardized raw clinical data into SDTM-compliant structure
- Added regulatory variables such as `STUDYID`, `DOMAIN`, `USUBJID`
- Maintained traceability between raw and SDTM datasets

**Domains created:**
- DM (Demographics)
- AE (Adverse Events)
- LB (Laboratory Data)

---

### 2️ SDTM → ADaM Dataset Creation
Built analysis-ready datasets used by statisticians:

- **ADSL** – Subject-level analysis dataset
- **ADAE** – Adverse events analysis dataset
- **ADLB** – Laboratory analysis dataset

Each dataset follows the **one-record-per-analysis-unit** principle.

---

### 3 Derivations Performed

Common industry derivations were implemented, including:

- Age group categorization (`AGEGRP`)
- Analysis population flags (`SAFFL`, `ITTFL`)
- Numeric severity derivation (`ASEVNUM`)
- Serious adverse event flag (`SAEFL`)
- Baseline lab values (`BASE`)
- Change from baseline (`CHG`)

These derivations ensure datasets are **analysis-ready**.

---

### 4️ TFL Generation (Tables)

Created standard analysis tables used in clinical reporting:

- **Demographic summary**
- **Adverse event frequency tables**
- **Laboratory shift and change-from-baseline summaries**

---

### 5 Submission-Style Output

- Generated a structured Excel file with separate sheets for each table
- Output is formatted for **statistical review and regulatory submission**

---

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Clinical data standards (SDTM, ADaM concepts)
- Statistical programming logic
- Data derivation and traceability
- Regulatory-style reporting

---

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository represents my **day-to-day practice in Statistical Programming**, designed to:

- Strengthen understanding of clinical data standards
- Simulate real project workflows
- Prepare for Statistical Programmer / Clinical Data roles
- Demonstrate practical skills to hiring managers

---

## Note

This project uses **synthetic clinical data** created solely for learning and demonstration purposes.
